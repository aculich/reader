# Distant Reader

The Distant Reader is a high performance computing system which takes an almost arbitrary amount of unstdructured data (text) as input and outputs a set of structured data for analysis -- "reading". As a high performance computing system, the Distant Reader is not a single computer program but instead a suite of softare comprised of many individual scripts and applications. Personally, I see the scripts and applications akin to collection of poems expressing aspects of the human condition. Really. Seroiusly.

As a collection of scripts and applications, the Distant Reader has only been built by "standing on the shoulders of giants". Liste in no particular order nor necessarily complete, they include:

   * the Perl-based LWP modules - this software is a significant part of harvesting process
   
   * Wget - an absolutely wonderful Internt spidering application
   
   * Tika - an Java-based library which transforms just about any file into plain text
   
   *
