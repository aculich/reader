<h1>About your study carrel</h1>

<p>
This page outlines the breadth & depth of your "study carrel" -- the results & analysis of your Distant Reader submission. Peruse the content of this page, and then consider learning how to dig deeper by reading the Distant Reader Study Carrel Cookbook. If you want "just the facts", then consider reading this text's synopsis. 
</p>


<h2>Simple things</h2>

<p>
First, the simple things. Your study carrel was created through the submission of a [SINGLE URL|FILE OF URLS|FILE FROM YOUR COMPUTER|ZIP FILE]. This ultimately resulted in a <strong>collection of ##NUMBEROFITEMS## item(s)</strong>. The original versions of these items have been saved in a <a href='./cache'>cache</a>, and each of them have been transformed &amp; saved as a <a href='./txt'>set of plain text files</a>. All of the following analysis has been done against these plain text files.
</p>

<p>
Each item in your study carrel is, on average, <strong>##AVERAGESIZEINWORDS## words long</strong>. [1] If you dig deeper, then you might want to save yourself some time by reading a shorter item. On the other hand, if your desire is for more detail, then you might consider reading a longer item. On a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 is very difficult and 100 is very easy, your documents have an <strong>average readability score of ##AVERAGEREADABILITSCORE##</strong>. [2] Consequently, if you want to read something more simplistic, then consider a document with a higher score. If you want something more specialized, then consider something with a lower score. The following histograms and box plots illustrate the overall size and readability of your study carrel.

<h2>Aboutness</h2>

By merely counting &amp; tabulating the frequency of individual words or phrases, you can begin to get an understanding of your carrel's "aboutness". Excluding "stop words", some of the more frequent words include: <strong>##FREQUENTUNIGRAMS##</strong>. And the most frequent two-word phrases (bigrams) include: <strong>##FREQUENTBIGRAMS##</strong> [3] While often deemed superficial or sophomoric, rudimentary frequencies and their associated "word clouds" can be quite insightful:

</p>

Concordancing these words -- displaying them as keywords in context -- provides additional insight: [4]
