<h1>Distant Reader - Home</h1>
<p>This site -- The Distant Reader -- applies text mining &amp; natural language processing against a corpus of materials which you provide. The result is akin to an interactive "study carrel" -- a set of tools empowering you to read the whole more quickly and thoroughly. To elaborate, the Distant Reader is like to a table-of-contents or a back-of-the-book index on steroids. It extracts data &amp; information from the input enabling you to read the corpus "at scale and at a distance".</p>

<p>The Distant Reader takes a number of different types of input:</p>

<ul>

	<li><a href="./file2carrel.html">A single file</a> - Given a single file (such as a PDF file or Word document), the Distant Reader will create a study carrel from the embedded text. This is useful for "reading" a scholarly journal article.</li>

	<li><a href="./url2carrel.html">A single URL</a> - Given a single URL, the Distant Reader will shallowly crawl a remote website, and create a study carrel with what it finds. Use this input to "read" the the whole of journal's current issue.</li>

	<li><a href="./urls2carrel.html">A file of URLs</a> - Given a file listing any number of URLs, the Distant Reader will cache the content pointed to by the URLs, and create a study carrel accordingly. This type of input is sometimes more difficult to create, but it is often more targeted than some of the others.</li>

	<li><a href="./zotero2carrel.html">A Zotero file</a> - Given an RDF file exported from Zotero, the Distant Reader will harvest content at the other end of URLs found in the export and create a study carrel accordingly. Use this input to drill into the citations of your research.</li>

</ul>

<p>The Distant Reader is brought to you by the Navari Family Center for Digital Scholarship in the Hesburgh Libraries at the University of Notre Dame.</p>
